## Course Description

Good app design means fewer bugs, lower maintenance costs, and happier users. In this course, Server Component Fundamentals in React, you’ll learn about React Server Components and how you can use them to provide a better user experience. First, you’ll dive into the technology behind server components so that using them makes sense. Next, you’ll explore how to build Server Components that work with async data sources. Finally, you’ll learn how to incorporate Server Components in a real-world app so that your apps provide great browser user experiences and are easy to build. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have all the knowledge and tools necessary to build apps with React Server and Client Components that provide excellent and performant UIs for your users.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-react-server-component-fundamentals` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-react-server-component-fundamentals/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m4` - `cd m4-clip-060`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`



## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
